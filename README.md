# @RoboRosewater Cube
A Magic: the Gathering Cube based on cards produced from @RoboRosewater on Twitter

I've intentially excluded cards that are incoherent or impractical.

The goal is to eventualy compile a 360-card Cube that can be drafted by 8 players and improved over time as new cards are added to the mix. Additionally, we wish to eliminate cards that break the color pie as quickly as possible (I'm looking at you, Creature and Beom Bump).
